        <h1>Privacy Policy - Fwordle</h1>
        <p>We at Nigelware respect your privacy. We are glad to tell you more about which data is accessed, how it is used, and which services we use to enhance your Fwordle experience.</p>

        <h3>1.0 How We Try to Continuously Improve Fwordle</h3>
        <p>We use analytics services as described in Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 of this Privacy Policy that help us understand how Fwordle is being used. The processing of your personal data takes place in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). We do not share any personal data.</p>

        <h4>Usage Information</h4>
        <p>We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (such as frequency, duration of usage, app crashes, features you've been using).</p>

        <h4>Device Information</h4>
        <p>We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, app version, app name, type of user (premium/free), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser.</li>
            <li>Information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal strength.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.0 Email & Support</h3>
        <p>The only situation we may get access to your personal identifiable information (PII) is when you personally decide to email us your feedback or to provide us with a bug report. The PII we may get from you in that situation are strictly limited to your name, email address, and the contents of your response only. In the above situation, we guarantee that your PII will only be used for contacting you and improving our services. We will never use such information (e.g., your name and email address) for any other purposes, such as to further market our products, or to disclose your personal information to a third party for commercial gains.</p>

        <h3>3.0 Ads</h3>
        <p>Ads are annoying. We currently do not do any in-app ads. We do not use any 3rd party ad services. Period.</p>

        <h3>4.0 Social Media</h3>
        <p>We maintain a presence on several social networking and blogging platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Google, WordPress, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Twitter. We may incorporate some third-party social networking features into our Services (including allowing users to interact with others and share certain content and information on social media platforms) or utilize third-party provided platforms to publish or manage the Services or portions thereof. Through these platforms and features, we receive or may share information about you, and this Privacy Policy applies to that information as well. In addition, some providers of third-party social media or blogging platforms we utilize have their own privacy policies which explain how the third parties that provide them may collect, use, and protect your information (e.g., if you establish an account with such platform providers directly). By using social features, you agree to those third parties' privacy policies and terms of use.</p>
        <p>If you choose to communicate with us or another user through social features available on our websites or mobile applications or through our social media pages, or other similar communication or messaging features or services, such information may be made publicly available. For security purposes, please do not include any password, social security number, payment card, or other sensitive information via these features. We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor messages and communications between and among users for security and training purposes. We may, but are not obligated to, remove any content we deem inappropriate.</p>

        <h3>5.0 Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>Our services are intended for general audiences over the age of 13 years old (or over the age of 16 if you are resident in the EEA). We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 years old, or 16 years old in the EEA. If you are not over 13 years old (or 16 years old in the EEA), then <strong>DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR USE THE SERVICES</strong>.</p>

        <h3>6.0 Last Updated</h3>
